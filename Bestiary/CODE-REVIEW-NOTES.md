DID IT
- removed app.routes and routeroutlet etc.
- removed various unused things

ACTIONABLE
- We should look into setting up a linter to catch unused vars
- Check TODOs with `grep -ri TODO src/`

Not actionable?
- It seems odd to me that environments is in src/


/* TODO: crush and/or remove this. */
